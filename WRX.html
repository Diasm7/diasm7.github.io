			If you are looking for a step into a performance car but not ready to spend on a STI then look no further. The WRX is famous for its look, All-wheel-drive, and boxer engine. This car is a beauty and is ready to hit the road. As I said it is a step into the performance being that it is a model up from the base Imperza. For stance or Performance this car will be enjoyable to drive to say the least.
