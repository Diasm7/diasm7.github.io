		On this website, we will be looking at a few car ideas that I have been looking and will be discussing with the rest of you. A bit of a background on me, I am a business management student with a interest in cars. My family has been into cars since they were young and basically caught my interest. I currently drive a Mazda 3 and might possibly modify it as soon as I graduate from college. This site is also a platform of knowledge to help fellow car lovers to get an idea on what they should do. We will be talking about stages and product with links to a few sites I would personally use to modify my own car or a car in the future. Below is a picture of my car currently:

		So let's discuss a few terms before we go into the projects below. First off, What are stages? I went over a bit in the description above but never describe what they are. Stages in simple are a guide that you should follow to bring your car, truck, or SUV to a certain point. They are usually package upgrades but sometimes a good guide to bring your car to a certain point. Some will argue that it is simply a gimmick or that it is amazing. Personally it is up to you to decide what it truly is.

		Another few terns that will be common in this site will be Performance and Stance cars. A performance car is just has the name may imply, a car that is made to perform normally for racing. A stanced car is another customization style where the car is usually just for show. Most stance cars are lowered with nice rims and the tires camber "camber deals with the wheels being tilted or off center".

		Now let's get into the fun stuff, the below links will lead to a few projects that I have in mind and in it you will find some videos on ideas for both performance and stance as well as summary with each link. In addition, there will be a site for parts if you are interested or just looking for a good site. Enjoy!
