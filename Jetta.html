			When it comes to Jettas, they hold a very special place in my heart. My first car was a jetta and I did not have eough time with it to truly modify and get it to a place I wanted it to be. But if you are looking to modify one then you are at the right place.

			This video shows a owner turboing his VR6 engine and reconstructing it from almost bare bolts. I think anyone looking to get a Jetta that has a VR6 engine should take a look at this video and for those mechanics who are thinking about doing it themselves.

			So what is "bagged"? A car that is bagged means they use a airbag suspension. The airbags fill and raise the car and when you park and choose to deflate the bags then the car will sit right on the tires and almost "kissing" the floor.
