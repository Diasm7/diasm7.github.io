			If you haven't checked the WRX page then welcome to modifying your STI. The STI is a step up above the WRX and nothing like its base model. I know a few individuals with some amazing STI builds. This is a project I look forward to do in the future. I hope this page helps fellow STI lovers and any potential owners.
