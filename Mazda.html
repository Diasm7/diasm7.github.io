			Welcome to the Mazda Forum, first off I would like to say I love my car. For anyone looking to get into building a mazda, you should first decide either what year or what your looking to do. I have seen both a performance mazda 3 and a stance mazda 3. The image I chose for this forum is a great example of a stance mazda 3 and she is a beauty. I hope you enjoy the links below and would love to hear your input perhap give me some ideas as well.

			In this video, the owner goes over a few of his modifications that he did. He explains what he did and the work he did himself. Overall this video gives some great ideas for those who need a good starting point on appearance mods.

			As the name will imply, this video goes over a owner's mazda 3 and his engine modifications. It is brought into the shop to be tested on the dyno. Great watch for those looking into performance or some crazy engine builds!

			This video is a personal favorite of mine and an inspiration for me to build my car in a similar fashion. Without spoiling the video, this is great for anyone looking to modify a 2014 and up mazda 3. Truly enjoy.

			Calling anyone who has an interest in mustangs but own a mazda 3. These lights are just right for you. The mustang style lights take the design of the mustang's headlights and mixs them with the mazda 3 headlights to make a fusion of the two. Go on and click the link to check them out.
